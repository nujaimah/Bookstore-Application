# Bookstore-Application

A simple Book Store Application that is graphical user interface (GUI) based and built using Java. The application allows admins/customers to log in to the system and access a book store database that contains information on books (name, price). Admins can add/remove new books and add/remove customers. Customers that are added to the database can log in to the system and purchase books and redeem points for book purchases.
